Yet another python particle simulator.

This project is _extremely_ unstable and should in no situation be used. This warning will not be taken down till more... 'user friendly' systems are set up.

As a result, there will be no explanations on usage. Sorry brah.

But just so you know what this is : it's a personal project where I wanted to build particle system simulators (much like what you'd find in any good physics engine these days, I guess) for a lot of reasons. One, because I think it's interesting to think about physics problems from an algorithmic perspective and also because I want to try my hand at visualizations.


These files and their contents will shuffle about and do all kinds of unexpected things, so don't expect me to do anything 'proper' for a while until I get some basic functionality up and running.
